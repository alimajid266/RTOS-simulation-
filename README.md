This project implements a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm to simulate task execution in a real-time system using POSIX threads in C++. Each task includes a process ID, arrival time, burst time, and deadline. The scheduler ensures tasks are executed in the order of arrival using a basic thread model without preemption. It models a very basic and non-critical form of Real Time Operating System (RTOS) as we are using soft deadlines to identify and deal with deadlines. The simulation tracks execution time and identifies missed deadlines. A pipe is set up to enable inter-thread communication, although message passing is optional in this prototype. The simulation demonstrates core OS concepts such as scheduling, concurrency with threads, and deadline awareness. The project aims to solidify understanding of process control and scheduling under Linux.
